VueJS Review Exercise 1 until tea break and then for a while after - probably done by 3:40 ish
=======================
In a new app, declare a root element for the app and compose the app using one or more components.
Feel free to write everything in one file, or use separate JavaScript/vue files.

Invite the user to enter a city and country then click a button
When the button is clicked, the values provided will be appended to an array of user-entered data
Show this array on the page in an unordered list

Also compose a footer component containing a short copyright statement

Optional
--------
When rendering the list, also show a button for each list item
Write an event handler such that clicking the button removes that member from the array

Find a way to disable the button until the city and country have been provided

Add one more input field for username, bound to a data model in the component
Provide a computed property which takes the username and assembles it something like this:
	https://graph.facebook.com/username/picture?type=normal
	(where username is replaced by whatever they entered for the user name)
Bind this to the src of an image, so any FaceBook ID will show the public image of that user
	e.g. try billgates, mickeymouse, pluto etc.
