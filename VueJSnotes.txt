> Welcome and introductions
  > what you currently know
  > what you want to know
> check the setup: install volar for VS Code
- modern ES: back-ticks, ...
> Vue is three parts: vueJS, vue-cli and vue-router
> online references
> no build step
> binding in, out and two-way
> Vue cli
- Bootstrap
> lifecycle hooks: onMounted
> conditional content
> iterating (best to provide a key)
> template syntax (and invisible template tag) ... always inspect the generated code
> ref() and reactive()

Tuesday
> retrieving and sending server-side data
  vue used to use axios but now recommends fetch
> watched (everything else is not watched)
> simple routing
> build app with options or with composition
> architecture
- supporting older browsers...
- props and state, also setting defaults, required and types
> after lunch review: use lifecycle, fetch, state
- v-if compared to v-show
> browser cache
> building a production version

Wednesday
> use latest ECMAscript - see the unpacking syntax
> axios is still fine
> pure functions and pure components
> custom events and ways to pass data around
> use best practice and architecture where possible
> css and Flexbox
  see https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/
> single page apps with modules
> namespacing states (and vuex)
> let the server do server stuff and let the client do client stuff
> after lunch review
> named routes - can use programatically
> More routing: passing parameters, named routes/named outlets
  NB anything in Vue that starts with a dollar sign $ is part of Vue itself
  e.g. $route, $props, $root
