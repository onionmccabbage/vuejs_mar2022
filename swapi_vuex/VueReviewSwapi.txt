Vue JS Swapi Exercise
======================
Create a new vue-cli app and start it. Provide fields and models so users enter a category and  number and see Star Wars data from https://swapi.dev/api/people/1 (or any data end point)

Use routing parameters to switch between the field-entry view and the results view
Initially just show the 'name' value, then use routing to show a component which binds to a few category-specific data members. Use different components for each category

Optional
--------
Listen to lifecycle events to log (in a logging model) stats about a component, e.g. create/update/routing events. Provide an 'admin' component which summarises these stats

Provide a log-in component (with just a button) to log in/log out by setting some model property
Guard the admin page from access unless logged in

Use a Vuex Store with mutators and actions to manage all the data models

When the data comes back, iterate over the 'films' data to show a custom list of the films
